/* Sets up strumq structure for strum to use as plucked string.
   Uses a two point averaging filter to adjust the phase for exact
   correct pitch, and then uses a linear phase three point averaging
   filter to adjust the fundamental frequency to decay in time tf0,
   and in time tNy at the Nyquist frequency.  In some cases, the
   decay time at the Nyquist frequency (which always must be less than
   tf0) will not be exactly as requested, but a wide range of variation
   is possible.  The two point and three point filters are combined into
   a single four point filter.  A single pole dc-blocking filter is added
   because the four point filter may have some gain a dc, and non-zero dc
   response can cause problems with clicks and what not.
   Randfill must be called after (and not before) this routine is called the
   first time, as it initializes some things in the strumq structure.
   This routine does not initialize them so it may be used to change parameters
   during the course of a note.
