Example: spike_generation (hears)
=================================

Example of the possible interfacing of Brian.hears with Brian.

Model of the spike generation at the auditory nerves. The sound is filtered by a
bank of gammatone filters and is half wave rectified.
The output of this pheripheral model is fed to  leaky integrate and fire
neurons, in particular the output of the filterbanks is the input current of
the neurons.
