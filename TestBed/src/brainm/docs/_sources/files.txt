File management
===============
A few functions are provided to read files with common formats.

The function :func:`read_neuron_dat` reads a Neuron .dat text file
and returns a vector of times and a vector of values. This is the format
used by the Neuron simulator when saving the time-varying value of a variable
from the GUI. For example::

  t, v = read_neuron_dat('myfile.dat')

The function :func:`read_atf` reads an Axon .atf text file and
returns a vector of times and a vector of values. This is a format used
to store data recorded with Axon amplifiers. Note that
metadata stored in the file are not extracted.
Binary .abf files are currently not supported.
