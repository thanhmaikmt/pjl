<p>
This java applet generates Fresnel <a href="http://homepages.tig.com.au/~flavios/diffrac.htm">diffraction</a> patterns, which are patterns
similar to the shadows cast by small apertures
when using a point source of monochromatic light as a light source.
<p>
When you start up the applet, a circular aperture will be used.
This is the pattern generated when a plane source of monochromatic
light is shined on a small circular hole in an otherwise opaque
object.  The red line is the outline of the geometrical shadow
(the shadow which would be cast if there were no diffraction).
<p>
You can select a different aperture shape (such as a half plane, double
slit, triple slit, rectangle, etc.) from the <b>Aperture popup</b>.
Or you can change the size of the circle by dragging the red line
with the mouse.
<p>
The diffraction pattern generated depends on the size of the aperture
compared to the wavelength of the light source.  To change the size
of the aperture, you can drag the red line; or, you can
change the <b>Aperture Scale</b> slider, which will modify the
scale of the aperture without changing the scale of the image.
If you move the slider to the right, this will make the aperture
larger relative to the wavelength of the light; this reduces the
effects of diffraction.  If you move it to the left, it will make
the aperture smaller, which increases the amount of diffraction.
<p>
The <b>Zoom</b> slider will modify the scale of the image, without
changing the scale of the aperture compared to the wavelength.
<p>
The <b>Brightness</b> slider can be used just like the brightness on
a TV, to brighten dim areas on the screen.  Often times you may see
large, boring areas of black or white on the screen which change into
interesting patterns when the brightness is turned to just the right setting.
<p>
The <b>Image Resolution</b> slider can be used to generate a higher
quality image.  If you move it to the right, it will increase the
resolution of the image, but it will also slow things WAY down,
so be careful.
<p>
The <b>Set to Defaults</b> button will reset all the settings to the
default, which can be a quick way to recover if you set the
Image Resolution slider too high and the applet has slowed to a crawl.
<p>
The <b>Tri-Chromatic</b> checkbox will cause the light source to emit
red, green, and blue light.  These three colors have different wavelengths,
which means they generate different diffraction patterns.  The applet will
generate the three patterns and combine them to create a color image.
This checkbox makes the images a lot more interesting but it also
slows things down a bit.
<p>
The <b>Reversed</b> checkbox will reverse the aperture so that transparent
areas become opaque and vice versa.  So if you have the default
setting (a circular hole in an opaque object)
and check this checkbox, you will wind up with a circular obstacle
in the path of the light source.  This is not the same as reversing
the colors on the image.
<p>
The <b>Show Dimensions</b> checkbox will tell you the width of the
aperture (and its geometrical shadow).  The point of observation is
four meters away from the aperture.  The wavelength of the light
is 510 nm for a monochrome image, and for a color image the wavelengths
are 650 nm (red), 510 nm (green), and 475 nm (blue).
<p>
It may be unclear what dimension "width" refers to for
some apertures.  The width
of the half plane or corner
is the distance from the left edge of the
aperture
to the right side of the screen.  The width of the double slit is the
distance from the left end of the left slit to the right end of the
right slit.  The width of the cross is simply the width of the screen.
<p>
The <b>Alternate Rendering</b> checkbox is used to speed up
rendering, but it actually slows things down on some machines.
Try selecting this, and then play with the brightness slider a bit.
If it seems slower, then uncheck this box.  If it's faster than
leave it alone.
<p>
This algorithm used by the circular apertures in this applet is from a paper by
<a href="http://www.dauger.com">Dean Dauger</a> called
"Simulation and Study of Fresnel Diffraction for Arbitrary
Two-Dimensional Apertures", published in <i>Computers In Physics</i>,
Nov/Dec 1996.  More info about
