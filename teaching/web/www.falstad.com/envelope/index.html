Sorry, you need a Java-enabled browser to see the simulation.

This applet plays a variety of cool, old-time-videogame-like sounds.  To
start, click the <b>Sound on</b> checkbox and then select one of the presets.
<p>
The intent is to loosely emulate the pitch envelopes from the
<a href="http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/bbc/">Acorn BBC microcomputer</a>,
but most people haven't
heard of that nowadays (still not sure why I was given one for work, especially
in the US).  So here is a brief description of how envelopes work.
<p>
The pitch changes in steps; the length of time a step takes
is adjustable using the
<b>Step Length</b> slider.  At each step, the pitch changes by the
value specified in the <b>Step Size 1</b> slider.  The starting pitch
is 89, which is middle C, and the pitch can go as low as 0 (about 72 Hz)
to 255 (about 2890 Hz), and it wraps around if it is incremented above
255 or below 0.  A pitch difference of 48 equals an octave.
<p>
After some number of steps (specified by the <b>Step Count 1</b> slider),
we finish section 1 and start section 2, where the <b>Step Size 2</b> and
<b>Step Count 2</b> sliders control the size and number of steps.
Then we go to section 3, and when that is finished we go back to section 1.
If the step count for a specific section is 0, then we just skip that section.
<p>
Just play around with the sliders and you'll figure it out.
<p>
The sound is output using a pulse waveform.  The <b>Pulse Width</b> slider
controls the pulse width.
