<STRONG>BASTILLE DAY, 2002 </STRONG></br>By Bill Bonner<P> "One man has a skinny wife, and wants a fat one... another has a fat wife and wants a skinny one."<P>- The Marquis de Sade explains why people join revolutions </br>Marat/Sade by Peter Weir<P>"They've gone mad.</br>George III<P> "Vive la revolution!" <P>Only an American would say such a thing at a Bastille  Day celebration. Raising our glasses at yesterday's  picnic, the Frenchmen looked puzzled, then amused, at my  toast. Everybody celebrates the 14th July in France. But  no one would want to see a return of the revolution.<P>"Oh...there were some good things and some bad things  that came out of it," said a friend on Sunday. Asked  what the good things were, he couldn't think of any. <P>We wonder from time to time how it will all turn out -  we mean the Great Bear Market and the long, soft, slow  depression that America seems to be entering. What  happens when a great people get themselves into a great  mess? <P>The French Revolution was a terrible mess. By the 18th  century, France had become the greatest power in Europe,  the richest and most populous country in the western  world, and the clear leader in art, science, philosophy,  education, cuisine, fashion, architecture...and, of  course, viticulture. It had the richest people in the  world, the prettiest women, and the best booze. <P>It also had the most enlightened economists - the  physiocrats - from whom Adam Smith was boosting some of  his best ideas.<P>A poll taken in the early 1780s might have shown the  French to be extremely optimistic and confident. And why  shouldn't they be? The last major financial crisis -  caused by John Law's Mississippi Bubble - blew up over  60 years before. And had the world ever seen anything  approaching the splendor of Versailles? <P>But in 1789, Paris mobs came to the crossroads of  history and veered left. They replaced an absolute  monarch who had very limited power, with a people's  republic restrained neither by common sense nor common  decency. <P>The uprising began on July 14th, 1989, at the old prison,  the Bastille, which was seen as an emblem of the ancien  regime. The prison was stormed by the Paris proles, who  took the guards hostage (promising they could go  unharmed if they laid down their guns) and released a  handful of lunatics and hoodlums from their cells. Then,  the crowd hacked the unarmed guards to pieces and  paraded around the city with body parts on the end of  pikes.   Not long after, the "law of the lamppost" became the  ruling order in Paris: aristocrats, CEOs, government  officials and army officers were hung from streetlights.  The Marquis de Lafayette, the liberator of the American  colonies, tried to maintain order at the command of the  National Guard. Lafayette was supposed to be guarding  Louis XVI when a mob attacked the palace at Versailles  on the 4th of October, 1789. A few raggedy women broke  into the palace trying to kill Marie-Antoinette, who  fled to her husband's bedchamber. There, the attackers  backed off. They may have doubted that Louis was put in  his place by God himself...maybe God wouldn't mind if  they cut up the Bourbon king; but the femmes decided not  to take a chance.<P>Lafayette intervened, telling the crowd that he would  make sure Louis returned to Paris - where the king would  be at the mercy of the radical new government. A few  years later, Louis and his family went to the  scaffold...along with thousands of others. France was  soon at war with nearly all its neighbors, and with the  Vendee, a region in west of the country that refused to  go along with the revolution. Church property was  confiscated, a new paper currency - the assignat - was  created, and then destroyed, by inflation. Outrages to  the clergy, the aristocracy, the language, and even the  calendar were perpetrated. <P>None of this might have happened, however, except for  the efforts of the Alan Greenspan of the late 18th  century - Jacques Necker. It was Necker who replaced  laissez-faire economist, Jacques Turgot, as French  finance minister in 1776. <P>Turgot's free-trade policies had the fatal flaw of all  sensible rules - they benefited everybody to the  advantage of nobody in particular. Turgot dissolved the  guild system, eliminated the corvee (the forced labor of  the peasants), imposed a simple property tax and opposed  all forms of economic privilege at the expense of the  common good. He even set himself against Marie  Antoinette, by refusing to grant favors to her cronies.  Since everybody in France in the 18th century as well as  every American in the 21st wanted the privilege of  picking someone else's pocket, Turgot eventually made  enemies of nearly every class. Louis XVI, though  responsible for the well-being of the entire nation, had  not the strength to stand up to the special interests. <P>Turgot even had a prophetic intuition and a view of  history similar to our own. Periods of civilized  progress are followed, he noted, by periods of barbarism  and madness. Dismissed in 1776, he warned Louis XVI: "Do  not forget, Sire, that it was feebleness that placed the  head of Charles II on the block."<P>Necker made enemies of no one. His program was the  opposite of Turgot's; he favored particular privileges  at the expense of everybody else. Rather than tax people  to pay for state expenses, Necker borrowed - taking  short-term, high-interest loans that brought the  government close to bankruptcy. Then, Necker turned to  accounting tricks to show that the government was  actually running a surplus! The patsies loved it.<P>Pushed out for the first time in 1781, Necker was called  back on the eve of revolution in 1788 for another dose  of his financial magic. But it was too late. The old  miracle elixirs - heavier debt and cooked books -  wouldn't work any longer; bankruptcy was unavoidable.  The aristocrats got rid of him again - on July 14, 1789.  The mob, which still had faith, was so disappointed...it  headed for the Bastille.<P>Your correspondent, <P>Bill Bonner<P> P.S. The American revolution was not a revolution at all  - but just a revolt. The American colonists had gotten  used to having their own way in the wilderness of North  America. When King George III tried to reassert his  control, Americans took up arms. An American in  Baltimore or Philadelphia might have gone about his  business before the War of Independence, during and  after, and hardly have noticed the change. <P>Not so in France, where the revolution left hardly  anyone undisturbed. Even my house in rural France - 200  miles from Paris - changed hands when the owners fled  the country to avoid the guillotine. <P>P.P.S. King George III was no stranger to madness. He  was already going mad from porphyria when the French  revolution began. Thought cured on more than one  occasion, George went mad permanently in the early 19th  century and was replaced by his son, George IV.
