Here I have a metal pot on the stove.  This pot seems to do a very good
job of making sure the heat goes to the inside and not to the outside
(or the handles).  In the second picture you see a nonstick cookie sheet
which does a surprisingly bad job of conducting heat.  Apparently heat
conduction is not a big deal for bakeware.
