Here I have a ceramic pot on the stove.  This pot is a terrible conductor
of heat, so the heat just goes around the outside of the pot.  The
second picture was taken
just to the right of the first, and you can see an artifact
on the
left side of the picture (the rainbow-like thing) because
the pot on the left is so bright/hot.  (Might be diffraction pattern caused by
the chopper.)  In the third picture
I have turned off the stove, but both the stove and the pot are still hot.
