These are shots of the refrigerator door.  You can clearly see a
reflection of the rice cooker, which is behind the camera and to the
right.  It's a brushed stainless steel door, and does not make a
clear reflection when viewed normally (with visible light, as in the
third picture).  But, it
seems to act like a mirror for thermal radiation.  I'm not sure why,
but I assume it is
because the wavelength of thermal radiation is too long to be scattered
by the imperfections in the brushed steel surface.
