Here you can see a plate that I put in the microwave.  The first picture
shows the plate heated without the turntable.  In the second picture,
I used the turntable, so the plate was heated more evenly.  In the third
picture I put some ice cubes on the plate from the second picture.  In the
fourth picture
you can
see a cup with water in it, which I put in the microwave for about a
minute.  Whenever I use this cup in the microwave to heat water, the handle
is always the hottest part, much hotter than the water, as you can
see.  Apparently, the particular radiation pattern in our microwave
causes that
to happen.
