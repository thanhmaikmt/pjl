==============================================

If you want to launch the applet without the web class loader (might be
faster when debugging/developing):

Change from this line:

AppletLauncher.launchAppletUsingURLClassLoader(PjlApplet.class.getName(),800,600,new URL("http://localhost:8080/psychoserver/applets/"),new String[] {"language=no","country=NO"});

To this line:
 //AppletLauncher.launchApplet(new PjlApplet(),800,600,new URL("http://localhost:8080/psychoserver/applets/"),new String[] {"language=no","country=NO"});

What is the web class loader all about? 

The reason is to get a view of what classes that should be available via
http (to the remote brower class loader). This way you'll easily find if
there are classes that the appletserver won't give away. If that is the
case, you can add them to allowedClasses in web.xml (or you can disable
the access control entirely - which is not recommended in production
though...)

You'll also see that it tries to write to a file called jarcontents.xml
- this is a feature for creating a .jar on the fly. Currently this
feature is not used - classes are loaded by the browser one by one...

==============================================

With your current setup you are able to debug client side code (the
applet code) - set breakpoints e.g.

If you want to be able to do the same with server-side code, you have to
launch jboss from within Eclipse in debug mode. This way you'll also be
able to modify methods of classes without having to restart jboss or
redeploy the application.

If modifying server side class structure (adding methods, new classes
etc.) you need to at least redeploy. You can do this very easily by
touching psychoserver.ear/META-INF/application.xml. This will trigger a
scan of the application for new session beans, entity beans, classes and
configuration.

A tool to launch jboss from Eclipse is JBoss Eclipse IDE - which is an
eclipse plugin. You can install it from within Eclipse (Help -> Software
updates -> Find an install) - by adding the site:

http://download.jboss.org/jbosside/updates/development

This will also require you to install an EMF component which is
available under the Callisto Discovery site.
