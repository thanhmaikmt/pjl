'''
Network to demonstrate stopping a simulation during a run

Have a fully connected network of integrate and fire neurons
with input fed by a group of Poisson neurons with a steadily
increasing rate, want to determine the point in time at which
the network of integrate and fire neurons switches from no
firing to all neurons firing, so we have a network_operation
called stop_condition that calls the stop() function if the
monitored network firing rate is above a minimum threshold.
