Precalculated tables
--------------------
One way to speed up simulations is to use precalculated tables for complicated
functions. The :class:`Tabulate` class defines a table of values of the
given function at regularly sampled points. The :class:`TabulateInterp` class
defines a table with linear interpolation, which is much more precise. Both work
with scalar and vector arguments.
