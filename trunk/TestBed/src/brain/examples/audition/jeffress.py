'''
Jeffress model, adapted with spiking neuron models.
A sound source (white noise) is moving around the head.
Delay differences between the two ears are used to determine the azimuth of the source.
Delays are mapped to a neural place code using delay lines (each neuron receives input
from both ears, with different delays).
