    The set of thresholds initially applied to the integration waveform is computed from

    where all the variables refer to the integration waveform:
    
    PEAKI is the overall peak,
    SPKI is the running estimate of the signal peak,
    NPKI is the running estimate of the noise peak,
    THRESHOLD Il is the first threshold applied, and
    THRESHOLD 12 is the second threshold applied.
    
    
    A peak is a local maximum determined by observing when the signal changes direction within a predefined time interval. 
    The signal peak SPKI is a peak that the algorithm has already established to be a QRS complex. 
    The noise peak NPKI is any peak that is not related to the QRS (e.g., the Twave). 
    The thresholds are based upon running estimates of SPKI and NPKI. 
    That is, new values of these variables are computed in part from their prior values. 
    When a new peak is detected, it must first be classified as a noise peak or a signal peak. 
    To be a signal peak, the peak must exceed THRESHOLD I1 as the signal is first analyzed or THRESHOLD 12 if searchback is required to find the QRS. 
    When the QRS complex is found using the second threshold-,
    
    SPKI = 0.25 PEAKI + 0.75 SPKI. 
    
    The set of thresholds applied to the filtered ECG is determined from
    
    SPKF = 0.125 PEAKF + 0.875 SPKF (if PEAKF is the signal peak)
    
    NPKF = 0.125 PEAKF + 0.875 NPKF (if PEAKF is the noise peak)
    
    THRESHOLD F1 = NPKF + 0.25 (SPKF - NPKF)
    THRESHOLD F2 = 0.5 THRESHOLD Fl
    
    where all the variables refer to the filtered ECG:
    
    PEAKF is the overall peak,
    SPKF is the running estimate of the signal peak,
    NPKF is the running estimate of the noise peak,
    THRESHOLD Fl is the first threshold applied, and
    THRESHOLD F2 is the second threshold applied.
    
    When the QRS complex is found using the second threshold,
    
    SPKF = 0.25 PEAKF + 0.75 SPKF. 
    
    For irregular heart rates, the first threshold of each set is reduced by half so as to increase the detection sensitivity and to avoid missing beats:
    THRESHOLDII v- 0.5 THRESHOLD II 
    THRESHOLD Fl 0.5 THRESHOLD Fl. 
    
    To be identified as a QRS complex, a peak must be recognized as such a complex in both the integration and bandpass-filtered waveforms.
