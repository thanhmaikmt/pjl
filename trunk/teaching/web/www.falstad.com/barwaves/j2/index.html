If you get a message "need java2 for this applet" or the
applet doesn't load, then you 
can use the <a href="/barwaves/">Java 1 version of this applet</a>
(but the sound
won't be as good).  If you don't have Java 2 I recommend
you go get the <a target="_blank"
href="/cgi-bin/go.pl?http://java.sun.com/getjava/">Java plug-in</a>
if you are on Windows.  If you have an older browser like IE5, the
Java plug-in is faster anyway.  But the latest Microsoft VM (in IE6) seems to
be slightly faster than the Java plug-in so you might not want to use the
plug-in
all the time, since most applets out there do not require Java 2
features.  The plug-in can be enabled and disabled as needed in the
IE configuration.

This java applet is a simulation that demonstrates
standing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/waves/mechwave.htm">flexural waves in a bar</a>.
<p>
At the top of the applet on the left you will see the bar.
To set the bar in motion, click on it and drag around to deform it,
or click "Fundamental".
<p>
Below the bar you will see a graph showing each
normal mode's contribution to the bar's vibration.
There are two sets of indicators; on top are the magnitude indicators, which
shows the amplitude of each normal mode.  These can be
adjusted with the mouse, or you could double-click on one to isolate
a particular mode.
<p>
The setup menu in the upper right has other variants of the bar (with
different boundary conditions) for you to try.
