<p>
This applet demonstrates various properties of
<a href="http://iq.orst.edu/mathsg/vcalc/vcalc.html">vector fields</a>.
You can select from a number of vector fields and see how
particles move if it is treated as either a velocity
or a force field.  This helps you visualize the field.
<p>
When you start the applet, you will see 500 particles moving in the
<tt>"1/r^2 single"</tt> field, which is a field that attracts
particles to the center.  By default the
particles are treating the field as a <i>velocity</i> field, which means
that the field vectors determine how fast the particles are moving and in
what direction.  In this case, the particles just move toward the center.
The velocity of all the particles at a certain point
on the grid is always the same.  If the field is a <i>force</i> field, then the
field vectors determine the acceleration of the particles, but their velocity
may vary depending on where they started.
<p>
The <b>Field Selection</b> popup will allow you to select a
vector field.  The choices are:
<ul>
<li><b>1/r^2 single</b>: 
This field is associated with gravity and electrostatic attraction.
The gravitational field around a planet and the electric field
around a single point charge are similar to this field.
The field points towards the origin and is inversely proportional
to the square of the distance from the origin.

<li><b>1/r^2 double</b>:
This field is associated with gravity and electrostatic attraction.
The gravitational field around two planets and the electric field
around two negative point charges are similar to this field.
The separation of the two centers is adjustable.
<li><b>1/r single line</b>:
This field is associated with electrostatic attraction.
If we calculate the electric field around an infinitely long conductor
in a straight line with a uniform charge along its length, we find that
the field strength is
inversely related to the distance from the line.
<br><img src="f1r.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>1/r double lines</b>:
This is the field around two infinitely long conductors.  The distance
between them is adjustable.
<li><b>1/r rotational</b>:
In this field, the particle is being pulled in a circle around the
center line.  The speed of its motion is inversely proportional to its
distance from the line.
If we calculate the magnetic field around an infinitely long conductor
in a straight line with a uniform current along its length, we find that
the field strength is
inversely related to the distance from the line.
<br><img src="fth1r.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>1/r rotational double</b>:
Here we have two centers of rotation, with an adjustable distance
between them.
<li><b>1/r rotational double + ext</b>:
Same as above, but a constant external field is added in.
The strength and angle of the external field is adjustable.
<li><b>1/r rotational dipole</b>:
Here we have two centers of rotation, with rotation in
opposite directions, with an adjustable distance between them.
<li><b>1/r rotational dipole + ext</b>:
Same as above, but a constant external field is added in.
The strength and angle of the external field is adjustable.
(In fluid dynamics this field is called the
<a href="http://www.fluid.tue.nl/users/jos/VDG/lamb-dip.html">Lamb
dipole</a>.)
<li><b>one direction</b>:
This is a very simple field where the field vectors are pointing
in the same direction everywhere with the same magnitude.
<br><img src="fax.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>1/r^2 sphere</b>:
This field is associated with gravitational attraction.
Consider the gravitational field around a planet.
Outside the planet, the field acts as if the planet were a point
mass; the field is inversely proportional to the square of the
distance from the center of the planet.
<br><img src="fsphere.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>const radial</b>:
In this field, the particle is being pulled towards the center
with a constant force no matter where it is.  I am not aware of
any real physical force that behaves like this, but if there were
one, this is what it would look like.
<br><img src="far.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>linear radial</b>:
In this field, the particle is being pulled towards the center
with a force proportional to its distance from the center, similar
to the force on an object attached to a spring.
This force
looks more interesting when <b>Display: Particles (Force)</b> is
used instead of a velocity field.
<br><img src="fkrr.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>constant to z axis</b>:
In this field, the field vectors are pointing
towards the z axis with the same magnitude everywhere.
<li><b>constant to xy plane</b>:
The field vectors are pointing
towards the xy plane with the same magnitude everywhere.
<br><img src="fabs.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>linear to z axis</b>:
The field vectors are pointing
towards the z axis with a force proportional to the distance
to that axis.
This force
looks more interesting when <b>Display: Particles (Force)</b> is
used instead of a velocity field.
<li><b>linear to xy plane</b>:
The field vectors are pointing
towards the xy plane with a force proportional to the distance
to that plane.
This force
looks more interesting when <b>Display: Particles (Force)</b> is
used instead of a velocity field.
<br><img src="fkx.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>linear to yz, xz plane</b>:
There is a force
towards the yz plane proportional to the distance
to that plane, as well as a similar force
towards the xz plane.  The relative strength of the two
forces is adjustable.
This force
looks much more interesting when <b>Display: Particles (Force)</b> is
used instead of a velocity field; in that case, the particles
trace out
<a href="http://members.aol.com/edhobbs/applets/lissajous/">Lissajous figures</a>.
These are easier to see after hitting the <b>Reset</b> button, or when
using a small number of particles.
<br><img src="fkxky.gif" vspace=10><
<li><b>linear to yz, xz, xy planes</b>:
There is a force
towards the yz plane proportional to the distance
to that plane, as well as similar forces
towards the xz and xy planes.  The relative strength of the three
forces is adjustable.
This force
looks much more interesting when <b>Display: Particles (Force)</b> is
used instead of a velocity field.
<li><b>inverse to xy plane</b>:
There is a force
towards the yz plane inversely proportional to the distance
to that plane.
<br><img src="f1x.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>1/r^2 rotational</b>:
In this field, the particle is being pulled in a circle around the
center.  The speed of its motion is inversely proportional to the
square of the distance from the center.
<br><img src="fthr2.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>linear rotational</b>:
In this field, the particle is being pulled in a circle around the
center.  The speed of its motion is directly proportional to the
distance from the center.
<br><img src="fthr.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>fz=-(x^2+y^2)</b>: Here the force is
equal to (0, 0, -(x^2+y^2)).  The curl of this field is the
<b>linear rotational</b> field.
<li><b>constant rotational</b>:
The particle is being pulled in a circle around the
center.  The speed of its motion is fixed.
<br><img src="fkth.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>(0,0,-r)</b>:
The curl of this field is the <b>constant rotational</b> field.
<li><b>helical</b>: here the particles move in a helix.
<li><b>fx=y</b>
<br><img src="fy0.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>fx=y^2</b>
<br><img src="fy2.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>(-yz,xz,0)</b>
<br><img src="fmyzxz.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>(yz,xz,0)</b>
<br><img src="fyzxz.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>(-x,-y,2z)</b>: this is the curl of (-yz,xz,0).
<li><b>(-x,y,0)</b>: this is the curl of (yz,xz,0).
<br><img src="fsaddle.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>(x-y,x+y,0)</b>
<br><img src="frrth.gif" vspace=10>
<li><b>(x-y,x+y,2z)</b>
<li><b>R&ouml;ssler attractor</b>:
This is a <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~trose/rossler.html">strange
attractor</a> discovered by Otto R&ouml;ssler.
The parameter <b>c</b> (from the field equations)
is adjustable, as well as the scale in the
z direction.
<li><b>Lorenz attractor</b>: this is another <A href="http://www.zeuscat.com/andrew/chaos/chaos.html">strange attractor</a>,
discovered by Edward Lorenz.  You can make
the attractor pattern larger or smaller by adjusting the scale.
<li><b>user-defined potential</b>: this allows you to enter
an arbitrary potential function into a text box.  The field vectors
will be calculated from it.  A sample potential is <tt>x*x-z*z</tt>,
which is a saddle potential.  Here are some other sample expressions,
to give you an idea of the input format:
<pre>
x+y-z
-x^2+5.2*y
2*sin(x)+3*y
1000/(r^2)-5*z
abs(x)
exp(2*log(x+10))+sqrt(y+10)
</pre>
After entering a new potential, press return so that the change
takes effect.  If nothing happens, then the field may be too weak; either
increase the field strength, or multiply the field by a large constant.
If particles jump around randomly with no apparent pattern, the field
may be too strong.
<p>
Each coordinate ranges
from -10 to 10, so the edges of the box are at (&plusmn;10,&plusmn;10,&plusmn;10).
The center of the box is the origin.
<li><b>user-defined field</b>: this allows you to enter
an arbitrary field into text boxes (one for each coordinate).
If you try to enter some of the predefined fields (like <tt>(yz,xz,0)</tt>)
into the text boxes so you can modify them, keep in mind that the
correct input format is <tt>y*z</tt>, not <tt>yz</tt>.  Also the field
will not appear exactly the same, because many of the predefined
fields have a constant scaling factor that isn't reflected in the name
of the field.
</ul>
<p>
The <b>Display</b> popup will allow you to select how the field
is displayed:
<ul>
<li><b>Display: Particles (Vel.)</b> means particles will move through
the field, with the field vectors determining their velocity.
Note that the particles are only a educational device
intended to show what the field looks like;
in real life, particles would not move in this manner.
<li><b>Display: Particles (Force)</b> means particles will move through
the field, and the field vectors determine their acceleration.
<li><b>Display: Field Vectors</b> shows you the field vectors at an array
of locations.
<li><b>Display: Streamlines</b> shows you the streamlines.  The
<b>Line Density</b> slider controls how many streamlines to draw.  The
color indicates the field strength.
<li><b>Display: Equipotentials</b> shows you equipotential surfaces.
By default slicing is turned on because the equipotentials are easier
to see that way, and you can see more than one at a time.  Red means
negative potential, green means positive, gray means ground.  If you
turn slicing off, you can only see one equipotential at a time;
the <b>Potential</b> slider allows you to determine which one to
view.  If the slider is set too high or too low then the corresponding
equipotential surface may not be visible or may not exist, so just
play around with the slider a bit if you don't see anything.
</ul>
<p>
The <b>Mouse</b> popup controls what happens when you click on the box.
If you set it to <b>Adjust Angle</b> or <b>Adjust Zoom</b>, you can
adjust the orientation or size of the 3-d view by clicking and
dragging on the box.
<p>
The <b>Slice</b> popup allows you to look at planar slices of the box
rather than looking at the contents of the entire box.
If the popup is set to <b>No Slicing</b>, you view the entire
box.  Otherwise you will see the box sliced in one of three
directions.  The location of the slice can be adjusted by dragging
the line running along the sides of box near the slice.
<p>
The <b>Stopped</b> checkbox will stop the particles.
<p>
The <b>Reverse</b> checkbox will reverse the direction of all the
field vectors.
<p>
The <b>Reset</b> button can be used to reset the positions of
all the particles to random values.
<p>
The <b>Kick</b> button can be used to give all the particles a
random acceleration in some direction. 
This is only allowed if the particle movement is set
to "Force".  It can be useful if none of the particles are moving,
or if they are all moving in the same direction.
<p>
The <b>Field Strength</b> slider makes the field stronger or weaker,
and also adjusts the brightness of the field vectors if you
have <b>Display: Field Vectors</b> selected.
<p>
The <b>Vector Density</b> slider controls the number of vectors present
if you have <b>Display: Field Vectors</b> selected.
<p>
The <b>Number of Particles</b> slider allows you to reduce the number
of particles, which can be useful if you want to watch the behavior of
just a few of them.  Also it might speed things up if you have fewer
particles.
<p>
A few additional field-specific sliders may be present,
depending on the field you have selected.
