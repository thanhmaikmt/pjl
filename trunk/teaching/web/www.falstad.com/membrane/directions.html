<p>
This java applet is a simulation that demonstrates wave motion
in a perfectly elastic <a
href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/music/recmem.html">rectangular
membrane</a> (like a drum head, except rectangular instead of round),
showing its various vibrational modes.
<p>
An ideal continuous membrane has an infinite number of modes of oscillation,
each with its own frequency.  The lowest-frequency mode is called the
fundamental, and involves the entire membrane vibrating up and down
at a frequency determined by the membrane's size, tension, and mass.
The other modes involve parts of the
membrane (called nodal lines) standing still while the rest of the membrane
vibrates.  When a membrane is vibrating, more than one mode is typically
present at once.
<p>
<p>
At the top of the applet on the left you will see the membrane.
To set it in motion, click <b>Fundamental</b>.
If you click <b>Clear</b>, it will be at rest again.
<p>
Below the membrane you will see a graph showing each
normal mode's contribution to the membrane's vibration.
The modes are laid out in the following order:
<p>
<table border>
<tr>
<td align=center>1,1</td>
<td align=center>2,1</td>
<td align=center>3,1</td>
<td align=center>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>1,2</td>
<td align=center>2,2</td>
<td align=center>3,2</td>
<td align=center>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>1,3</td>
<td align=center>2,3</td>
<td align=center>3,3</td>
<td align=center>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>...</td>
<td align=center>...</td>
<td align=center>...</td>
<td align=center>...</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
where <i>m,n</i> refers to the mode having a shape proportional to
sin(<i>mx</i>)sin(<i>ny</i>), where x ranges from 0 to pi.  So, mode 1,1 has one "bump" and does not have
any nodal lines.  Mode 3,2 has six bumps (3 in the x direction and
2 in the y direction), so it has two nodal lines crossing the x axis
and one nodal line crossing the y axis.  In general, mode <i>m,n</i>
has <i>m</i>*<i>n</i> bumps, <i>m</i>-1 nodal lines crossing the x axis,
and <i>n</i>-1 nodal lines crossing the y axis.
<p>
Normally the edges of the membrane are fixed.
If the <b>Fixed Edges</b> checkbox is turned off, then the edges are
free to vibrate, and this causes a new set of modes to be available:
<p>
<table border>
<tr>
<td align=center></td>
<td align=center>1,0</td>
<td align=center>2,0</td>
<td align=center>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>0,1</td>
<td align=center>1,1</td>
<td align=center>2,1</td>
<td align=center>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>0,2</td>
<td align=center>1,2</td>
<td align=center>2,2</td>
<td align=center>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>...</td>
<td align=center>...</td>
<td align=center>...</td>
<td align=center>...</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
where <i>m,n</i> refers to the mode having a shape proportional to
cos(<i>mx</i>)cos(<i>ny</i>).  Modes 0,<i>n</i> are constant in the x direction and
modes <i>m</i>,0 are constant in the y direction.  The slot for 0,0 is
left empty because this is simply a constant factor added to the height
of the membrane.  This constant is always 0 in this applet.
<p>
Each element of the grid has a color which indicates the presence or
absence of the mode it represents.  Black means the mode is not present;
green means the mode is present with a positive coefficient, and red means
it is present with a negative coefficient.  So in this example,
mode 1,2 has a positive coefficient, mode 3,1 has a negative one,
and the rest of the modes are absent:
<p>

<p>
In addition, each mode may have a phase shift, which indicates that its
oscillatory cycle leads or lags the others.  This is indicated by
a blue line.  In this example, mode 1,3 has a blue line about 1/3 of
the way across the width of the box, which means a phase shift of
about 1/3 the maximum possible.  The maximum is pi*2, so this shift is
pi*2/3.  Mode 2,2 is also present but does not have a phase shift.
<p>
<img src="grid2.gif">
<p>
A phase shift is normally hard to detect.  If the applet is stopped,
then by altering the phase of a mode you can see the mode oscillate
up and down.  If the applet is running it is much harder to tell,
except in a case which will be explained later.
<p>
You can add or remove a mode by clicking on it.  If you click and drag
up and down you can fine-tune the magnitude of the mode.  If you drag
left and right you can alter the phase shift.
<p>
<p>
You can modify the membrane in one of two ways.  You can
modify the normal modes.  Or you can
click on it directly and drag the mouse up or down;
it will be "poked" at that point.
<p>
The <b>Mouse</b> popup controls what happens when you click on the membrane.
The default setting is <b>Poke membrane</b>, which causes the membrane to be
deformed at the point where you click.
If you set the popup to <b>Shape membrane</b>, you can edit
the displacement of each individual point.
<p>
If you set it to <b>Adjust view angle</b> or <b>Adjust view zoom</b>, you can
adjust the orientation or size of the 3-d view.
And if you set it to <b>Show mode</b>, and then click on one of the modes
in the frequency grid, it will show the shape of that mode.
<p>
The <b>Display</b> popup can be used to control whether the 3-d or 2-d
view is shown.  By default it is set to <b>Display 3-d Only</b>.  To show a
2-d representation, you can select <b>Display 2d Only</b> or <b>Display 3d+2d</b>.
The 2-d representation often gives you a clearer picture of what is
going on.  Also the <b>Mouse = Shape membrane</b> popup menu item can be
used to alter multiple points on the membrane at once by drawing
on the 2-d representation.
<p>
The <b>3d View</b> popup can be used to control the look of the 3-d view.
By default it is set to <b>Solid</b>, but you can also see a wireframe
view by selecting one of the other options.
<p>
The <b>Stopped</b> checkbox can be used to stop the motion of the membrane
for a moment.
<p>
The <b>Show Frequencies</b> checkbox can be used to show or hide
the frequency grid.  By default, it is shown.
<p>
The <b>Color</b> checkbox can be used to turn off color.  This may
look better and/or it may make the applet run faster.
<p>
The <b>Simulation Speed</b> slider controls how fast the simulation will
proceed.
<p>
The <b>Damping</b> slider controls how much damping there is.  Damping is
a force that slows the membrane down.  High harmonics are damped more than lower ones.
The default
setting is set to zero, so you may want to set this higher in order to
get more realistic behavior.
<p>
The <b>Brightness</b> slider controls the brightness, just like on a
TV set.  This can be used to view faint waves more easily.
<p>
The <b>Resolution</b> slider will adjust the fineness of the
rendering.  This can be set lower to speed up the applet.
<p>
The <b>Aspect Ratio</b> slider will adjust the width of the membrane.
<p>
<p>
Normally each mode has a different frequency.  However in some cases,
several modes can have the same frequency.  This is called
degeneracy.  The presence or absence of degeneracy
depends on the aspect ratio of the membrane, which is its width relative
to its length.  This is controlled by the <b>Aspect Ratio slider</b>.
By default it is equal to one, which means the membrane is square.
In this case, all the <i>m</i>,<i>n</i> modes are degenerate, because
they have the same frequency
as the <i>n</i>,<i>m</i> modes.
If the aspect ratio is not equal to one,
there usually is no degeneracy.  There may be some if the aspect ratio
is equal to an integer or a simple fraction.  The aspect ratio slider
ranges from 1/2 to 3, so in either of those cases there will be some
degeneracy.
<p>
When two or more modes have the same frequency, each one is shown in
yellow, like so:
<p>

<p>
The interesting thing about degenerate modes is that if you combine
them, you get a new mode that oscillates with simple harmonic motion,
just like any other mode.  Since both modes are oscillating at the
same rate, you can't tell them apart.  If one of the modes has a phase
shift relative to the other one, then the membrane will change shape
at a rate equal to the frequency of the modes.
<p>
The frequencies are proportional to:
<p>
<img src="freq.gif">
<p>
where <i>L<sub>x</sub></i> is the length of the membrane in the x
direction and 
<i>L<sub>y</sub></i> is the length of the membrane in the y
direction.  So in the example grid shown above, modes (9,2)
have the same frequency as (2,9), (6,7), and (7,6), so all modes are
shown in yellow.  This makes sense if the membrane
is square.  In this case, <i>L<sub>x</sub></i> = <i>L<sub>y</sub></i>,
and 2<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> =
6<sup>2</sup> + 7<sup>2</sup> =
7<sup>2</sup> + 6<sup>2</sup> =
9<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 85.
