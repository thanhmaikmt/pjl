I took the rice out of the rice cooker and put it on the counter,
and then moved it to the right so you can see the warm spot where it
was.  Also you can see Ann with her coffee.  The last picture is a
hand print I made on the counter, and a cold spot made by an ice
cube I put there and then took away.
