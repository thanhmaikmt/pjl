This is me.  My mouth is dark (cool) because of my breath.  The black halo is
an artifact created by the camera.

Neal Butler sent me this info about the halo:
<p>
The technical reason for the dark halo around bright objects
is the chopper used in the Raytheon (now L3) system. The chopper is
transparent and alternately blurs the image or not before it reaches
the focal plane. The digital processing then subtracts the blurred
image from the sharp image. In the photography world, this is called
"unsharp masking". In the digital signal processing world, it is a
spatial high pass filter.
<p>
The chopper is really cool. It is a thin plastic film, with very high
IR transmission. Portions of the film have a 1/4 wave thick
diffraction pattern embossed on them. The diffraction pattern is
selected to have no energy in the zero order. That is, it effectively
blurs the image. As the chopper rotates, so does the diffraction
pattern, so no artifacts from the pattern are visible in the
imagery. This is so cool because the chopper weighs and costs almost
nothing.
<p>
The dark halo around bright objects is just the negative of the
blurred bright object. The chopper is necessary because ferro-electric
detectors have no response to DC. The chopper modulates the scene
radiance at 30 Hz so the detectors respond to it.
<p>
Raytheon chose to do things this way because it greatly reduces the
dynamic range and complexity of the signal processing. This basic
scheme has been around since about 1979, when the group was owned by
TI.
<p>
Modern micro-bolometer focal planes do not have a chopper and do not
show these effects.
