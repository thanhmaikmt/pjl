This java applet is a simulation that demonstrates the motion of
oscillators coupled by springs.  The oscillators (the "loads")
are arranged in
a line connected by springs to each other and to supports on the
left and right ends.  The mass of each load and the stiffness (spring
constant) of
each spring can be adjusted.
<p>
At the top of the applet on the left you will see the string of
oscillators in motion.  By default, the number of loads is set to 5.
To move the loads, click on one of them, drag it
slightly to one side and then release it.
<p>
Below the string you will see a graph showing each
normal mode's contribution to the motion.  
There are two sets of terms; on top are the magnitude terms, which
shows the amplitude of each normal mode, and on
the bottom are the phase terms.  Low-frequency modes are on the
left and high-frequency modes are on the right.
<p>
If you move the mouse over one of the modes, it will turn
yellow, and the motion of the corresponding mode will be
drawn underneath the line of oscillators in yellow (unless it's too small to see).  So if you move the mouse
over all the modes, you can see each of the terms individually.
<p>
(One thing to keep in mind when looking at the magnitude of
each mode is that the scale is not linear.
If it were linear, it would look like the higher-frequency modes all had
zero magnitude because their contribution is so small.
For small magnitudes, the scale is logarithmic; then about 1/4 of the
way up the scale it switches to linear.  The same is true for negative
magnitudes.)
<p>
You can modify the motion of the string in one of two ways.  You can
click on it directly, or you can modify the normal modes.
<p>
The <b>Setup popup</b> allows you to view some predefined interesting
cases.  The first two choices, <b>5 masses</b> and <b>2 masses</b>
are very simple.  The next two demonstrate weak coupling; in both
cases, you will see that the load on
the right will oscillate for a while, and then stop; meanwhile the one on
the left will oscillate, and then will stop while the right one oscillates,
etc.  This is because the two active modes
have frequencies that are very close, causing beats to occur.  Another
way to look at it is that energy is slowly transfered from the left load
to the right and then back again.
<p>
The <b>Mouse popup</b> controls what happens when you click on the string.
The default setting is <b>Pull string</b>, which causes the load you click on
to be pulled to either side.
If you set the popup to <b>Move load</b>, you can edit the position
of a single load without disturbing the others (until you release
the mouse button).
<p>
If you set it to <b>Modify masses</b>,
you can modify the mass of one of the loads by clicking on it and
dragging the mouse up or down.  The size of the load will be changed
to match its mass.
If you set it to <b>Modify springs</b>, you can modify the spring constant
of one of the springs by clicking and dragging up or down.
Springs with a high spring constant have a reddish color.
<p>
The <b>Reset Positions</b> button allows you to reset the positions
of all the loads to equilibrium.
<p>
The <b>Reset Masses</b> button allows you to reset the masses of
all the loads to
the default.
The <b>Reset Springs</b> button allows you to reset the springs to
the same spring constant.
<p>
The <b>Stopped</b> checkbox allows you to stop or start the simulation.
<p>
Occasionally two loads will collide, or one of the loads will hit the
edge.  If this happens, the loads involved will turn red briefly,
and the normal modes will be changed to match the new motion of the
string.  By default, the loads will collide inelastically, causing
them to move at the same velocity until they are pulled apart by
springs.  The <b>Elastic Collisions</b> checkbox allows you to change
this so that they collide elastically.
<p>
When the <b>Lissajous Figures</b> checkbox is checked, and there are two
loads (or two
active modes), then the amplitudes of these modes (their normal coordinates)
will be plotted, producing a Lissajous figure.  This makes the most sense
for cases of weak coupling.
<p>
The <b>Simulation Speed</b> slider controls how fast the simulation will
proceed.
<p>
The <b>Damping</b> slider controls how much damping there is.  Damping is
a force that slows the string down.  It is proportional to the speed of
the string, so high-frequency modes are damped more than lower ones.
<p>
The <b>Number of Loads</b> slider will adjust the number of loads on the
string.  This can be set as low as one.  If you reduce the number of
loads then you also reduce the number of normal modes.
